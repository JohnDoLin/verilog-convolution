# Verilog Convolution

This is my final project of 113-2 IC Design course in NTU. I made it almost by myself and without ChatGPT's help. 

In this repo, you will find the problem pdf, our team's verilog file as solution, and the final result of all teams. 

## Record
We were the team whose circuits used minimal time! 

## Note
The DRC metal short in the final result was a false alarm and the -4 deduction was removed. 

## Thank You!
Big thanks to my teammate @jrymk for providing `extract.py` to make the downloading from server possible!
